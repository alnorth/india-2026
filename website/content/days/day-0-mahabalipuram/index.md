We slept reasonably well, mainly thanks to the tiredness from the journey. The hotel breakfast was good, with a mixture of local and western options available.

The rain had carried on overnight, but we managed to take advantage of a gap in it to tour the temples that the town is famous for.

Our guide, Dillip, took us round Arjuna's Penance, Krishna's Butter Ball, Five Rathas and Mahabalipuram's Shore Temple. Some remarkable carvings into solid rock, creating small temples and other rock faces carved wth people and animals. The carvings date from the 7th and 8th centuries and are incredibly impressive, even though many remain unfinished thanks to the decline of the Pallavas.

Dillip is a stone carver as well as a guide, and he took us back to his shop and showed us his carvings. They are mostly small for tourists, with a lot of detail. All done by hand as the electric tools are not precise enough.

After a dosa masala for lunch and some shopping for snacks we headed back to the hotel for a rest. At that point the rain set in and lasted the rest of the day. We've been told by a few people that the rain is very unusual for this time of year, so hopefully we won't get much more. All forcasts think it should be dry from tomorrow mid morning for the next week.

Went for a walk on the beach but it was too wet to go far.

We had dinner at the same restaurant as last night. This time they did manage to tempt us to try the fish.
