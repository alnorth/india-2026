Our second day of cycling was a bit harder than the first. The roads we were on were a but busier, and I was feeling a bit off for the last 20 miles or so.

Leaving Pondicherry took a while. We tried to leave a bit early, but the traffic was already building to rush hour. Threading through the other vehicles is fun challenge at times, and bit nervewracking at others.

A lot of the roads today felt quite busy, without the relief of the quiet village backroads that we'd enjoyed yesterday.

About 40 miles in I started to feel a bit nauseous, so we had to stop for a bit. After a rest by the side of the road we pushed on to the next town and I had a bottle of Coke, which helped a lot. We carried on the rest of the ride at a gentler pace, and I had a good lie down when I got to the hotel.

I'm not sure what the issue was. It's possible I was reacting to something I ate, but I've played it relatively safe so far 🤷‍♂️

The hotel is OK, but definitely has the feel of a place that's seen better days. Everything is a little tired and run down. Dinner was surprisingly tasty, although it was served half an hour later than we'd asked for.

I got an early night in the hope of fighting off whatever's the matter with me.
